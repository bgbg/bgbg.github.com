Hello,

my name is Boris Gorelik. I'm a data scientist and algorithm developer.
Since May 2014 I'm a data scientist at [Automattic][a8c] -- the fabulous company behind the even more fabulous [WordPress][wp].At Automattic, I have the chance to analyze fascinating data that is generated by about 70,000,000 WordPress.com users. My main focus is churn prevention and social aspects of user engagement.

Until recently I worked at  RSA -- the security division of EMC. At RSA, I was a co-developer of an online outlier detection algorithm named [TAnDeM](tandem). This algorithm provides smart, flexible and robust risk assessment associated with online activities. It is designed for cases where the data are cheap; the labels are expensive, and the service providers do not tolerate black box solutions.

Before joining RSA, I worked for more than four years as a senior bioinformatician and later on as head of software and bioinformatics in [Procognia][prc] -- a small biotech company. Before Procognia, I was a bio-mathematical simulation person and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics expert in [Optimata][opt]. I worked in Optimata for about two years, just after graduating my [Ph.D. in computational chemistry][thsis] from  [The Hebrew Univeristy of Jerusalem][huji].

I'm also a registered pharmacist, but I don't enjoy talking about this :-)
