Hello,

my name is Boris Gorelik. I'm a data scientist, algorithm developer, data visualization enthusiast and occasional lecturer.
Since May 2014, I'm a data scientist at [Automattic][a8c] -- the company behind [WordPress.com][wp] and other projects. At Automattic, I have the chance to analyze fascinating data generated by more than 110,000,000 WordPress.com users. My current passion is the social aspects of user engagement. In [this talk][barilan-talk], presented in 2015, I talk about this research. One year later, I presented another set of interesting results at [WordCamp Israel][wordcamp-israel]. You can find these results [in my blog post][wordcamp-israel-post].

Follow my blog, [randomstratum.wordpress.com](https://randomstratum.wordpress.com) to learn more about data science, visualization and what I do at work.

## What did I do before my current position?

Until 2014 I worked at  RSA -- the security division of EMC. At RSA, I was a co-developer of an online outlier detection algorithm named [TAnDeM](tandem). This algorithm is designed for cases where the data are cheap; the labels are expensive, and the service providers do not tolerate black box solutions.

Before joining RSA, I worked for more than four years as a senior bioinformatician and later on, as head of software and bioinformatics in [Procognia][prc] -- a small biotech company. Before Procognia, I was a bio-mathematical simulation person and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics expert in [Optimata][opt]. I worked in Optimata for about two years, just after graduating my [Ph.D. in computational chemistry][thsis] from  [The Hebrew Univeristy of Jerusalem][huji].
