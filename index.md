Hello,

my name is Boris Gorelik. I'm a data scientist and algorithm developer. 
Ever since May 2014 I'm a data scientist at [Automattic][a8c] -- the fabulous company behind the even more fabulous [WordPress][wp].

Until recently I worked at  RSA -- the security devision of EMC. At RSA I was a co-developer of an online outlier detection algorithm. This algorithm (called [TAnDeM][tandem]) provides smart, flexible and robust risk assessment associated with online activities in cases where the data are cheap, the labels are expensive and the service providers do not tolerate black box solutions.

Before joining RSA I worked for more than four years as a senior bioinformatician and later on as head of software and bioinformatics in [Procognia][prc] -- a small biotech company. Before Procognia, I was a bio-mathematical simulation person and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics expert in [Optimata][opt]. I worked in Optimata for about two years, just after graduating my [PhD in computational chemistry][thsis] from  [The Hebrew Univeristy of Jerusalem][huji].

I'm also a registered pharmacist, but I don't enjoy talking about this :-)

Not too much, really. For now ...
