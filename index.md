Hello,

my name is Boris Gorelik. I'm a data scientist and algorithm developer,
currently working at RSA -- the security devision of EMC.

Before joining RSA I worked for more than four years as a senior bioinformatician
and later on as head of software and bioinformatics in [Procognia][prc] -
a small biotech company. Before Procognia, I was a bio-mathematical simulation person
and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics expert in [Optimata][opt]. I worked in
Optimata for about two years, just after graduating my [PhD in computational chemistry][thsis]
from  [The Hebrew Univeristy of Jerusalem][huji].

I'm also a registered pharmacist, but I don't enjoy talking about this :-)

##What's on this site?

Not too much, really. For now ...

##How to contact me?
The best and the easiest way is to write me to [boris@gorelik.net][mail]
